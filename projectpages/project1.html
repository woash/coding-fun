                I started with coding the background to show a school bus since Jovana got Mr. Chimp Chimp on a school trip and very quickly realized this wasn't as easy as I thought it was going to be. My first element (the seat) was meant to be curved and look more soft but working with curved elements is pretty difficult. I'm glad I figured out how to make at least one part of the seat curved. 
                <br> <br>I also had to spend some time to understand the layering of the elements since my sketch had overlapping shapes so I had to constantly order and reoder it.
                <br><br> It also took me a while to grasp the translate and rotate functions for the arms of the chimp and eventually I started eyeballing it which was a very different approach compared to how I started with an aim for precision but I learned that random mistakes can add a different and often interesting perspective to the sketch.            </div>
