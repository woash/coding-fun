                When the cute new guy at work gives you a chance of calling him over to your house for a nice little meal, you jump on the opportunity. Only problem is you don't know how to cook and may have lied about it.. not an issue since all you have to do to impress him is follow a simple recipe book, cooking can't be that hard... right?
                <br><br>
                Date Night : A liar's cookbook is part 1 of a series of educational games where the lying protagonist must fake it till she makes it. 
                <br><br>
                How to play : 
                
                Click on start to begin, once you reach the recipe scene, take your time and memorize the instructions that are highlighted, you MUST remember the order of the ingredients and the time to cook them for. If all goes well, you may enjoy your successful date (you sneaky liar), if you fail.... your date might not end so well.
