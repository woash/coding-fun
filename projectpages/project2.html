                I wanted to show an emotion incited by the user's cursor to make the interaction more playful and hands-on. 
                    <br> <br>I started with plotting the coordinates for the base of my face and played around with how much I wanted it to move - my first few variations had very elaborate movements but that made it harder to plan the rest of the facial features. The order of the variables took some trial and error as well, I kept changing their positions to test how it would react based on when it was initialized/declared.
                       <br> <br> I also wanted to try some other variable functions besides size and decided to add little blush circles that would deepen as the face got more expressive. 
                        To further add some randomness I added text that would change once you click on the face so it seems like it's shouting at you with changing bg colours and text sizes.        </div>
